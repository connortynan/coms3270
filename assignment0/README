Word search generator, given a board size and a list of words as command line arguments, generates a word search with all words and prints it to the terminal with a word list. Implements recursive backtracking, so any word list that has a possible solution will give a completed result.

---

Words can be placed in four directions: (↗ diagonal up,  → rightward, ↘ diagonal down, ↓ downward), meaning words will never be backwards horizontally (right-to-left), but can be written down-to-up if also diagonally left-to-right (but not purely vertical down-to-up)

Example: 'crossword'

<summary>These are the only 4 ways you'll find the word 'crossword' written on the board:</summary>

              r
            o

The board memory is dynamically allocated, so the board can be any size as long as it's a positive integer. The code sets a upper bound according to the specification, but this is a design choice, not a technical limitation.
