# termune / coms327 rougelike

Assignment 1.06 - “Fog of War” and porting to C++
---

Now in C++!

Game controls are identical to the requirements in the spec. (plus `Shift+H` as an additional debug cheat to show rock hardness)
The game ends when either the player is defeated, or all monsters are defeated.

The game window is centered in the terminal in cases where the terminal size is greater than the expected 80x24.

Build instructions
```
# Navigate to base directory (with CHANGELOG, Makefile, and README)
make
```

Usage
```
build/bin/termune [--save] [--load] [--nummon <int>]
```

Options:
 - `--save` saves the current dungeon to disk at `~/.rlg327/dungeon`
 - `--load` loads the last saved dungeon from disk at `~/.rlg327/dungeon`
 - `--nummon <int>` sets the number of monsters in the dungeon (default: 10).
 - Note: both `--save` and `--load` can be used together, which will read from the file and immediate write back to the same file the equivalent data.

Uninstall
```
make clean
```
