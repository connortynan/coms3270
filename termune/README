Assignment 1.07 - Monster and Object Parsing
---

This assignment implements a parser for monster and object definition files as described in the spec.  
The program reads from `~/.rlg327/monster_desc.txt` and `~/.rlg327/object_desc.txt`, parses each definition, and prints them out in the required format.

This assignment **does not** launch the game. It just reads the definition files and prints their contents, allowing verification of correct parsing.

Build instructions
```bash
# Navigate to base directory (with CHANGELOG, Makefile, and README)
make
```

---

Usage
```bash
build/bin/termune # [--save] [--load] [--nummon <int>]
```

~~Options:~~ **Options are not used in the program for this assignment**
 - `--save` saves the current dungeon to disk at `~/.rlg327/dungeon`
 - `--load` loads the last saved dungeon from disk at `~/.rlg327/dungeon`
 - `--nummon <int>` sets the number of monsters in the dungeon (default: 10).
 - Note: both `--save` and `--load` can be used together, which will read from the file and immediate write back to the same file the equivalent data.

Uninstall
```bash
make clean
```
