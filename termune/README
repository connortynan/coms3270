# termune / coms327 rougelike

Assignment 1.09 - PC Equipment and Updated Combat
---

Adds item equipment, inventory interaction, and turn-based combat with HP
Item list is currently broken, and combat seems to be bugged, but most everything else works fine

---

Build instructions
```bash
# Navigate to base directory (with CHANGELOG, Makefile, and README)
make
```

---

Usage
```bash
build/bin/termune [--save] [--load] [--nummon <int>]
```

Options:
 - `--save` saves the current dungeon to disk at `~/.rlg327/dungeon`
 - `--load` loads the last saved dungeon from disk at `~/.rlg327/dungeon`
 - `--nummon <int>` sets the number of monsters in the dungeon (default: 10).
 - Note: both `--save` and `--load` can be used together, which will read from the file and immediate write back to the same file the equivalent data.

---

Uninstall
```bash
make clean
```
