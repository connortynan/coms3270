# termune / coms327 rougelike

Assignment 1.02 - Dungeon Load/Save
---

The program by default does the same thing as 1.01, but now has support for `--save` and `--load` flags to save and load from disk.

---

The file structure has source files in `src/` and headers in `include/`.
the `include/util/` folder has header only utilities, and most actual game code is in the base `include/` and `src/` directories

---

Build instructions
```
# Navigate to base directory (with CHANGELOG, Makefile, and README)
make
```

---

Usage
```
bin/termune [--save] [--load]
```

Options:
 - `--save` saves the current dungeon to disk at `~/.rlg327/dungeon`
 - `--load` loads the last saved dungeon from disk at `~/.rlg327/dungeon`
 - Note: both `--save` and `--load` can be used together, which will read from the file and immediate write back to the same file the equivalent data.

---

Uninstall
```
make clean
```
