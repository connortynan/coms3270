# termune / coms327 rougelike

Assignment 1.05 - User Interface with Ncurses

Now an actual game!

Game controls are identical to the requirements in the spec.
The game ends when either the player is defeated, or all monsters are defeated.

The windows are centered in the terminal in cases where the terminal size is greater than the expected 80x24.

The `art` directory contains a supplemental python script to aid in converting text art to `#include`-able C code, this script is only ran during compliation, and not runtime.

Usage
```
build/bin/termune [--save] [--load] [--nummon <int>]
```

Options:
 - `--save` saves the current dungeon to disk at `~/.rlg327/dungeon`
 - `--load` loads the last saved dungeon from disk at `~/.rlg327/dungeon`
 - `--nummon <int>` sets the number of monsters in the dungeon (default: 10).
 - Note: both `--save` and `--load` can be used together, which will read from the file and immediate write back to the same file the equivalent data.
