# Navigate to base directory (with CHANGELOG, Makefile, and README)
make
```

Usage
```bash
build/bin/termune [--save] [--load] [--nummon <int>]
```

Options:
 - `--save` saves the current dungeon to disk at `~/.rlg327/dungeon`
 - `--load` loads the last saved dungeon from disk at `~/.rlg327/dungeon`
 - `--nummon <int>` sets the number of monsters in the dungeon (default: 10).
 - Note: both `--save` and `--load` can be used together, which will read from the file and immediate write back to the same file the equivalent data.

```bash
make clean
