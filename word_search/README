Given a board size and a list of words as command line arguments, generates a word search with all words and prints it to the terminal with a word list. 

This generator implements backtracking, so any word list that has a possible solution for a given board size will sucessfully find a solution (albeit very slow for large and dense boards).

---

Words can be placed in four directions: (↗ diagonal up,  → rightward, ↘ diagonal down, ↓ downward).

It is recommended to use all lowercase for the given word list, as the randomly filled characters are all lower case.

---

The first argument is the board size, which must be a positive integer less than 20, as per the project specification.

The second and onwards arguments are the word lists, which are seperated by spaces.
